NOTE 2: The value of this timer is not specified by this recommendation.

### 11.2.1 Timer T3240 and Timer T3241

Timer T3240 is started in the mobile station when:

\- the mobile station receives a LOCATION UPDATING ACCEPT message
completing a location updating procedure in the cases specified in
subclauses 4.4.4.6 and 4.4.4.8;

\- the mobile station receives a LOCATION UPDATING REJECT message in the
cases specified in subclause 4.4.4.7;

\- the mobile station has sent a CM SERVICE ABORT message as specified
in subclause 4.5.1.7;

\- the mobile station has released or aborted all MM connections in the
cases specified in 4.3.2.5, 4.3.5.2, 4.5.1.1, and 4.5.3.1;

\- the mobile station receives the paging message from network and enter
the MM state 9 (WAIT FOR NETWORK COMMAND).

Timer T3240 is stopped, reset, and started again at receipt of an MM
message.

Timer T3240 is stopped and reset (but not started) at receipt of a CM
message that initiates establishment of an CM connection (an appropriate
SETUP, REGISTER, or CP-DATA message as defined in 3GPP TS 24.008, 3GPP
TS 24.010 \[21\] or 3GPP TS 24.011 \[22\]).

If timer T3240 expires, the MS shall abort the RR connection and enter
the MM state MM IDLE.

Timer T3241 is started in the mobile station when entering MM state RR
CONNECTION RELEASE NOT ALLOWED.

Timer T3241 is stopped and reset (but not started) when the MM state RR
CONNECTION RELEASE NOT ALLOWED is left.

If timer T3241 expires, the MS shall abort the RR connection and enter
the MM state MM IDLE.

NOTE 1: Typically, the procedures are aborted on the fifth expiry of the
relevant timer. Exceptions are described in the corresponding procedure
description.

NOTE 2: The back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the
required MS behaviour. This model does not imply any specific
implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp.

NOTE 3: Reference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to
use of timer T3396 or to use of a different packet system specific timer
within the MS. Whether the MS uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses
different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to
MS implementation.

NOTE 1: The network may already have applied an internal alerting
supervision function; e.g. incorporated within call control. If such a
function is known to be operating on the call, then timer T301 is not
used.

NOTE 2: These time values are set by the network operator.

NOTE 3: When applied to the supplementary service CCBS, the timer T334
can either represent the recall timer T4 or the notification timer T10
(see 3GPP TS 23.093 \[88a\]). Thus the timer T334 can take two different
values. 3GPP TS 23.093 \[88a\] defines the range of these values.

########  Annex A (informative): Example of subaddress information element coding

This annex gives an example of how the Called Party Subaddress IE is
encoded to carry subaddress digits that use IA5 characters. This example
is also applicable to the Calling Party Subaddress IE.

NOTE 1: The value of this bit has no significance when the type of
subaddress is \"NSAP\".

NOTE 2: These bits are spare.

NOTE 3: The Authority and Format Identifier code 50 (in BCD) indicates
that the subaddress consists of IA5 characters (see ISO standard 8348
AD2).

NOTE 4: IA5 character as defined in ITU-T Recommendation T.50 \[52\]/ISO
646 and then encoded into two semi-octets according to the \"preferred
binary encoding\" defined in X.213 \[144\]/ISO 8348 AD2. (Each character
is converted into a number in the range 32 to 127 using the ISO 646
encoding with zero parity and the parity bit in the most significant
position. This number is then reduced by 32 to give a new number in the
range 0 to 95. The new number is then treated as a pair of decimal
digits with the value of each digit being encoded in a semi-octet.)

NOTE 5: the number of IA5 characters in the subaddress may vary, subject
to an upper limit of 19 IA5 characters.
