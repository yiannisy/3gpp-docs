P.3 Inter-system change between A/Gb mode and Iu mode
=====================================================

An MS is required to perform routing area updating for IMS voice
termination if:

1\) the upper layers have indicated that the MS is available for voice
calls in the IMS (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[120\], subclause 3.1);

2\) the MS is enabled for mobility management for IMS voice termination;

3\) the \"IMS voice over PS session indicator\" received for Iu mode has
the value \"IMS voice over PS session supported in Iu mode, but not
supported in A/Gb mode\"; and

4\) the voice domain preference for UTRAN as defined in
3GPP TS 24.167 \[134\] is not \"CS voice only\".
