P.2 Activation of mobility management for IMS voice termination
===============================================================

An MS activates mobility management for IMS voice termination when:

1\) the MS\'s availability for voice calls in the IMS (see
3GPP TS 24.301 \[120\], subclause 3.1) changes from \"not available\" to
\"available\";

2\) the MS is enabled for mobility management for IMS voice termination;

3\) the IMS voice over PS session indicator received for Iu mode has the
value

\- \"IMS voice over PS session supported in Iu mode, but not supported
in A/Gb mode\", or

the IMS voice over PS session indicator received for S1 mode has the
value

\- \"IMS voice over PS session in S1 mode supported\"; and

4\) at least one of the two parameters voice domain preference for UTRAN
and voice domain preference for E‑UTRAN as defined in
3GPP TS 24.167 \[134\] is not \"CS voice only\".

The MS deactivates mobility management for IMS voice termination when
the MS\'s availability for voice calls in the IMS (see
3GPP TS 24.301 \[120\], subclause 3.1) changes from \"available\" to
\"not available\".
