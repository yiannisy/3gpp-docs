O.2 User-user protocol contents 
================================

The user-user protocol contents is included in the user-user information
element described in subclause 10.5.4.25.

The user-user protocol contents is structured like the non-imperative
part of a standard L3 message (see 3GPP TS 24.007 \[20\],
subclause 11.2) and is composed of a variable number of information
elements of type 1, 2, 3 and 4. The different formats (TV, TLV) and the
categories of information elements (type 1, 2, 3 and 4) are defined in
3GPP TS 24.007 \[20\].

Within the user-user protocol contents the information elements may
occur in an arbitrary order.

All information elements shall be included only once.
