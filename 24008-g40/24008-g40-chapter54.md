=====================================================

An MS is required to perform routing area updating for IMS voice
termination at inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb mode and
tracking area updating for IMS voice termination at inter-system change
from A/Gb mode to S1 mode if:

1\) conditions 1 and 2 of annex P.3 are fulfilled;

2\) the \"IMS voice over PS session indicator\" received for S1 mode has
the value \"IMS voice over PS session in S1 mode supported\"; and

3\) the voice domain preference for E‑UTRAN as defined in
3GPP TS 24.167 \[134\] is not \"CS voice only\".
