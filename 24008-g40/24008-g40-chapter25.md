G.1 Causes related to MS identification
=======================================

Cause value = 2 IMSI unknown in HLR

This cause is sent to the MS if the MS is not known (registered) in the
HLR, or if the MS has packet only subscription (see
3GPP TS 29.272 \[150\]). This cause code does not affect operation of
the GPRS service, although is may be used by a GMM procedure.

Cause value = 3 Illegal MS

This cause is sent to the MS when the network refuses service to the MS
either because an identity of the MS is not acceptable to the network or
because the MS does not pass the authentication check, i.e. the SRES
received from the MS is different from that generated by the network.
When used by an MM procedure, except the authentication procedure, this
cause does not affect operation of the GPRS service.

Cause value = 4 IMSI unknown in VLR

This cause is sent to the MS when the given IMSI is not known at the
VLR.

Cause value = 5 IMEI not accepted

This cause is sent to the MS if the network does not accept emergency
call establishment using an IMEI or not accept attach procedure for
emergency services using an IMEI.

Cause value = 6 Illegal ME

This cause is sent to the MS if the ME used is not acceptable to the
network, e.g. blacklisted. When used by an MM procedure, this cause does
not affect operation of the GPRS service.
