B.2 Calling side compatibility checking
=======================================

B.2.1 Compatibility checking of the CM SERVICE REQUEST message
--------------------------------------------------------------

The network shall check if the service requested in the CM SERVICE
REQUEST message is permitted for that subscriber.

B.2.2 Compatibility/Subscription checking of the SETUP message
--------------------------------------------------------------

At the calling side the network shall check that the basic service(s)
requested by the calling MS in the Bearer Capability information
element(s) match(es) with the basic services provided to that subscriber
by the PLMN. If for at least one bearer capability information element
contained in the SETUP message a mismatch is detected, then the network
shall proceed as follows:

\- if the SETUP message contained two bearer capability information
elements for only one of which a mismatch is detected, the network shall
either:

\- under the conditions specified in 3GPP TS 27.001 \[36\] (e.g. TS 61
and TS 62), accept the SETUP message with a CALL PROCEEDING message
containing the, possibly negotiated, bearer capability information
element for which no mismatch is detected, or

\- reject the call using one of the causes listed in annex H.

\- otherwise the network shall reject the call using one of the causes
listed in annex H.

Network services are described in 3GPP TS 22.002 \[3\] and 3GPP TS
22.003 \[4\] as bearer services and teleservices, respectively.
