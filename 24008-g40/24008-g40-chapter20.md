C.1 Purpose
===========

This annex describes principles that shall be used when the calling MS
specifies information during call setup regarding low layer capabilities
required in the network and by the destination terminal. Refer also to
3GPP TS 27.001 \[36\].

NOTE: In this context and throughout this annex the term \"called user\"
is the end point entity which is explicitly addressed. This may also be
an explicitly addressed interworking unit (IWU) (see ITU-T I.500-Series
Recommendations and ITU-T Recommendation X.31 case a).
