O.1 Scope
=========

This annex specifies the protocol data units used by the 3GPP capability
exchange protocol and procedures for the handling of unknown,
unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by the receiving MS.

The 3GPP capability exchange protocol provides services for the
end-to-end exchange of capabilities between MSs. It is a separate
protocol which uses the user-to-user signalling service 1 of the layer 3
call control protocol as a means of transport.

Functional procedures which use the 3GPP capability exchange protocol in
the context of CSI are specified in 3GPP TS 24.279 \[116\].
