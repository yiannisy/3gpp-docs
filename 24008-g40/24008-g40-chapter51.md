P.1 Introduction
================

The present annex specifies additional requirements for GMM and EMM in
the MS for the support of terminating access domain selection for voice
calls or voice sessions by the network.

Support of these mobility management procedures can be configured in the
MS by a setting. Whether the mobility management for IMS voice
termination setting is stored in the IMS management object as defined in
3GPP TS 24.167 \[134\] (see the \"Mobility Management for IMS Voice
Termination\" leaf) or in an alternative way in the ME is an
implementation option. If this setting is missing, then mobility
management for IMS voice termination is disabled.
