G.3 Causes related to PLMN specific network failures and congestion/Authentication Failures
===========================================================================================

Cause value = 20 MAC failure

This cause is sent to the network if the USIM detects that the MAC in
the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST or AUTHENTICATION\_AND\_CIPHERING REQUEST
message is not fresh (see 3GPP TS 33.102 \[5a\]).

Cause value = 21 Synch failure

This cause is sent to the network if the USIM detects that the SQN in
the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST or AUTHENTICATION\_AND\_CIPHERING REQUEST
message is out of range (see 3GPP TS 33.102 \[5a\]).

Cause value = 17 Network failure

This cause is sent to the MS if the MSC cannot service an MS generated
request because of PLMN failures, e.g. problems in MAP.

Cause value = 22 Congestion

This cause is sent to the MS if the network cannot serve a request from
the MS because of congestion (e.g. congestion of the MSC or SGSN or GGSN
or PDN Gateway; no channel; facility busy/congested etc.).

Cause value = 23 GSM authentication unacceptable

This cause is sent to the network in Iu mode if a USIM is inserted in
the MS and there is no Authentication Parameter AUTN IE present in the
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST or AUTHENTICATION\_AND\_CIPHERING REQUEST
message.
