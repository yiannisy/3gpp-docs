### 2.1.1 Random values

In a number of places in the present document, it is mentioned that some
value must take a \"random\" value, in a given range, or more generally
with some statistical distribution. Such cases interest only the Mobile
Station.

It is required that there is a low probability that two MSs in the same
conditions (including the case of two MSs of the same type from the same
manufacturer) will choose the same value. Moreover, it is required that,
if it happens that two MSs in similar conditions choose the same value,
the probability of their choices being identical at the next occasion is
the same as if their first choices had been different.

The meaning of such a specification is that any statistical test for
these values, done on a series of similar events, will obtain a result
statistically compatible with the specified distribution. This shall
hold even in the cases where the tests are conducted with a subset of
possible events, with some common parameters. Moreover, basic tests of
independence of the values within the series shall pass.

Data against which correlation with the values shall not be found are
the protocol state, or the IMSI, or identities or other unrelated
information broadcast by the network, or the current TDMA frame number.

### 2.1.2 Vocabulary

For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and
definitions apply:

**-** A **GSM security context** is established and stored in the MS and
the network as a result of a successful execution of a GSM
authentication challenge. The GSM security context for the CS domain
consists of the GSM ciphering key and the ciphering key sequence number.
The GSM security context for the PS domain consists of the GPRS GSM
ciphering key and the GPRS ciphering key sequence number.

**-** A **UMTS security context** is established and stored in the MS
and the network as a result of a successful execution of a UMTS
authentication challenge. The UMTS security context for the CS domain
consists of the UMTS ciphering key, the UMTS integrity key, the GSM
ciphering key, the ciphering key sequence number and the GSM Kc~128~ (if
an A5 ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key is in
use). The UMTS security context for the PS domain consists of the GPRS
UMTS ciphering key, the GPRS UMTS integrity key, the GPRS GSM ciphering
key, the GPRS ciphering key sequence number, the GPRS GSM Kc~128~ (if a
GEA ciphering algorithm that requires a 128-bit ciphering key is in use)
and the GPRS GSM Kint (if a GIA integrity algorithm that requires a
128-bit integrity key is in use).

\- An MS is **attached for emergency bearer services** if it has
successfully completed an attach for emergency bearer services or if it
has only a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established.

\- **idle mode:** In this mode, the mobile station is not allocated any
dedicated channel; it listens to the CCCH and the BCCH;

\- **group receive mode:** (Only applicable for mobile stations
supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening) In this mode, the mobile
station is not allocated a dedicated channel with the network; it
listens to the downlink of a voice broadcast channel or voice group call
channel allocated to the cell. Occasionally, the mobile station has to
listen to the BCCH of the serving cell as defined in
3GPP TS 43.022 \[82\] and 3GPP TS 45.008 \[34\];

\- **dedicated mode:** In this mode, the mobile station is allocated at
least two dedicated channels, only one of them being a SACCH;

\- **EAB:** Extended Access Barring, see 3GPP TS 22.011 \[138\].

\- **group transmit mode:** (Only applicable for mobile stations
supporting VGCS talking) In this mode, one mobile station of a voice
group call is allocated two dedicated channels, one of them being a
SACCH. These channels can be allocated to one mobile station at a time
but to different mobile stations during the voice group call;

\- **packet idle mode**: (only applicable for mobile stations supporting
GPRS) In this mode, mobile station is not allocated any radio resource
on a packet data physical channel; it listens to the BCCH and the CCCH,
see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[76\].

\- **packet transfer mode**: (only applicable for mobile stations
supporting GPRS) In this mode, the mobile station is allocated radio
resource on one or more packet data physical channels for the transfer
of LLC PDUs.

\- **main DCCH:** In dedicated mode and group transmit mode, only two
channels are used as DCCH, one being a SACCH, the other being a SDCCH or
a FACCH; the SDCCH or FACCH is called here \"the main DCCH\";

\- A channel is **activated** if it can be used for transmission, in
particular for signalling, at least with UI frames. On the SACCH,
whenever activated, it must be ensured that a contiguous stream of layer
2 frames is sent;

\- A TCH is **connected** if circuit mode user data can be transferred.
A TCH cannot be connected if it is not activated. A TCH which is
activated but not connected is used only for signalling, i.e. as a DCCH;

\- The data link of SAPI 0 on the main DCCH is called the **main
signalling link**. Any message specified to be sent on the main
signalling link is sent in acknowledged mode except when otherwise
specified;

\- The term **\"to establish\"** a link is a short form for **\"to
establish the multiframe mode\"** on that data link. It is possible to
send UI frames on a data link even if it is not established as soon as
the corresponding channel is activated. Except when otherwise indicated,
a data link layer establishment is done without an information field.

\- **\"channel set\"** is used to identify TCHs that carry related user
information flows, e.g., in a multislot configuration used to support
circuit switched connection(s), which therefore need to be handled
together.

\- A **temporary block flow** (TBF) is a physical connection used by the
two RR peer entities to support the uni-directional transfer of LLC PDUs
on packet data physical channels, see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[76\].

\- **RLC/MAC block:** A RLC/MAC block is the protocol data unit
exchanged between RLC/MAC entities, see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[76\].

\- A **GMM context** is established when a GPRS attach procedure is
successfully completed.

\- **Network operation mode**

The network operation modes I and II are defined in
3GPP TS 23.060 \[74\].

The network operation mode shall be indicated as system information. For
proper operation, the network operation mode should be the same in each
cell of one routing area.

\- **GAN mode:** See 3GPP TS 43.318 \[75a\].

\- **GPRS MS operation mode**

The three different GPRS MS operation modes A, B, and C are defined in
3GPP TS 23.060 \[74\].

For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio
access network.

\- **In A/Gb mode,\...** Indicates this paragraph applies only to a
system which operates in A/Gb mode. For multi system case this is
determined by the current serving radio access network.

\- **In Iu mode,\...** Indicates this paragraph applies only to a system
which operates in UTRAN Iu mode. For multi system case this is

a shared network. For the definition of shared network see
3GPP TS 23.122 \[14\].

NOTE: A shared network is applicable to GERAN and UTRAN, however,
according to this definition, a multi-operator core network (MOCN) with
common GERAN is not considered a shared network in 3GPP TS 23.122 \[14\]
and in the present specification.
