B.1 Introduction
================

This annex describes the various compatibility checks which shall be
carried out to ensure that the best matched MS and network capabilities
are achieved on a call between a PLMN and the ISDN.

Three different processes of compatibility checking shall be performed:

i\) at the user-to-network interface on the calling side (see B.2);

ii\) at the network-user interface on the called side (see B.3.2);

iii\) user-to-user (see B 3.3).

NOTE: In this context and throughout this annex the term \"called user\"
is the end point entity which is explicitly addressed.

For details on the coding of the information required for compatibility
checking, see annex C.
