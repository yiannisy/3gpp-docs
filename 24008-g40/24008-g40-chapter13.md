10 General message format and information elements coding
=========================================================

The figures and text in this clause describe the Information Elements
contents.

10.1 Overview
-------------

Within the Layer 3 protocols defined in 3GPP TS 24.008, every message is
a standard L3 message as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 \[20\]. This means
that the message consists of the following parts:

a\) protocol discriminator;

b\) transaction identifier;

c\) message type;

d\) other information elements, as required.

This organization is illustrated in the example shown in figure
10.1/3GPP TS 24.008.

Figure 10.1/3GPP TS 24.008 General message organization example

Unless specified otherwise in the message descriptions of clause 9, a
particular information element shall not be present more than once in a
given message.

The term \"default\" implies that the value defined shall be used in the
absence of any assignment, or that this value allows negotiation of
alternative values in between the two peer entities.

When a field extends over more than one octet, the order of bit values
progressively decreases as the octet number increases. The least
significant bit of the field is represented by the lowest numbered bit
of the highest numbered octet of the field.

10.2 Protocol Discriminator
---------------------------

The Protocol Discriminator (PD) and its use are defined in 3GPP TS
24.007 \[20\].

10.3 Skip indicator and transaction identifier
----------------------------------------------

### 10.3.1 Skip indicator

Bits 5 to 8 of the first octet of every Mobility Management message and
GPRS MobilityManagement message contains the skip indicator.

With the exception of the following cases for a shared GERAN network in
A/Gb mode,

\- when the MS is sending a LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST, CM SERVICE
REQUEST, IMSI DETACH INDICATION or CM RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message;
or

\- when the network is receiving a LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST, PAGING
RESPONSE, CM SERVICE REQUEST, IMSI DETACH INDICATION or CM
RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message,

the skip indicator field shall be handled as follows:

a\) A message received with skip indicator different from 0000 shall be
ignored. A message received with skip indicator encoded as 0000 shall
not be considered an error that causes the message to be ignored.

b\) A protocol entity sending a Mobility Management message or a GPRS
Mobility Management message shall encode the skip indicator as 0000.

In a shared GERAN network in A/Gb mode:

a\) When the MS is sending a LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST, CM SERVICE
REQUEST, IMSI DETACH INDICATION or CM RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message,

\- if the MS is a GERAN network sharing supporting MS, the MS shall
encode the skip indicator IE to indicate the chosen PLMN identity from
the PLMN identities in the broadcast system information (see
3GPP TS 44.018 \[84\]) according to table 10.3.1;

\- otherwise, the MS shall encode the skip indicator as 0000.

b\) When the network is receiving a LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST, PAGING
RESPONSE, CM SERVICE REQUEST, IMSI DETACH INDICATION or CM
RE-ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message,

\- if the skip indicator is encoded as 0000, the message shall not be
considered an error that causes the message to be ignored;

\- if the skip indicator is different from 0000, the message shall not
be considered an error and shall be processed by the receiving MM
entity. The MS shall be considered as GERAN network sharing supporting
MS.

NOTE: The skip indicator handling of PAGING RESPONSE message on the MS
and the BSS is specified in 3GPP TS 44.018 \[84\].

### 10.3.2 Transaction identifier

Bits 5 to 8 of the first octet of every message belonging to the
protocols \"Call Control; call related SS messages\" and \"Session
Management\"contain the transaction identifier (TI). The transaction
identifier and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 \[20\].

For the session management protocol, the extended TI mechanism may be
used (see 3GPP TS 24.007 \[20\]).

For the call control protocol, the extended TI mechanism shall be
supported for the purpose of protocol error handling as specified in
subclause 8.3.1

10.4 Message Type
-----------------

The message type IE and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 \[20\].
Tables 10.3/3GPP TS 24.008, 10.4/3GPP TS 24.008, and 10.4a/3GPP TS
24.008 define the value part of the message type IE used in the Mobility
Management protocol, the Call Control protocol, and Session management
protocol.

10.5 Other information elements
-------------------------------

The different formats (V, LV, T, TV, TLV) and the four categories of
information elements (type 1, 2, 3, and 4) are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007
\[20\].

The first octet of an information element in the non-imperative part
contains the IEI of the information element. If this octet does not
correspond to an IEI known in the message, the receiver shall determine
whether this IE is of type 1 or 2 (i.e. it is an information element of
one octet length) or an IE of type 4 (i.e. that the next octet is the
length indicator indicating the length of the remaining of the
information element) (see 3GPP TS 24.007 \[20\]).

This allows the receiver to jump over unknown information elements and
to analyse any following information elements.

The information elements which are common for at least two of the three
protocols Radio Resources management, Mobility Management and Call
Control, are listed in subclause 10.5.1.

The information elements for the protocols Mobility Management and Call
Control are listed in subclauses 10.5.3 and 10.5.4 respectively. Default
information element identifiers are listed in annex K.

NOTE: Different information elements may have the same default
information element identifier if they belong to different protocols.

The descriptions of the information element types in subclauses 10.5.1,
10.5.3, and 10.5.4 are organized in alphabetical order of the IE types.
Each IE type is described in one subclause.

The subclause may have an introduction:

\- possibly explaining the purpose of the IE;

\- possibly describing whether the IE belongs to type 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5;

\- possibly indicating the length that the information element has if it
is either type 5 or if it is used in format TV (type 1 and 3) or TLV
(type 4).

A figure of the subclause defines the structure of the IE indicating:

\- possibly the position and length of the IEI. (However it depends on
the message in which the IE occurs whether the IE contains an IEI.);

\- the fields the IE value part is composed of;

\- possibly the position and length of the length indicator. (However it
depends on the IE type whether the IE contains a length indicator or
not.);

\- possibly octet numbers of the octets that compose the IE (see clause
a) below).

Finally, the subclause contains tables defining the structure and value
range of the fields that compose the IE value part. The order of
appearance for information elements in a message is defined in clause 9.

The order of the information elements within the imperative part of
messages has been chosen so that information elements with 1/2 octet of
content (type 1) go together in succession. The first type 1 information
element occupies bits 1 to 4 of octet N, the second bits 5 to 8 of octet
N, the third bits 1 to 4 of octet N + 1 etc. If the number of type 1
information elements is odd then bits 5 to 8 of the last octet occupied
by these information elements contains a spare half octet IE in format

contains bits defined to be \"spare bits\", these bits shall set to the
indicated value (0 or 1) by the sending side, and their value shall be
ignored by the receiving side. With few exceptions, spare bits are
indicated as being set to \"0\" in 3GPP TS 24.008.

### 10.5.1 Common information elements.

#### 10.5.1.1 Cell identity

The purpose of the *Cell Identity* information element is to identify a
cell within a location area.

The *Cell Identity* information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.1/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.1/3GPP TS 24.008.

The *Cell Identity* is a type 3 information element with 3 octets
length.

| The cell identity consists of 2 octets.                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

#### 10.5.1.2 Ciphering Key Sequence Number

In a GSM authentication challenge, the purpose of the *Ciphering Key
Sequence Number* information element is to make it possible for the
network to identify the ciphering key Kc which is stored in the mobile
station without invoking the authentication procedure.

The ciphering key sequence number is allocated by the network and sent
with the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST or AUTHENTICATION AND CIPHERING REQUEST
message to the mobile station where it is stored together with the
calculated keys, e.g. Kc, CK, IK, Kc~128,~ Kint.

The *Ciphering Key Sequence Number* information element is coded as
shown in figure 10.5.2/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.2/3GPP TS 24.008.

In a UMTS authentication challenge, the purpose of the *Ciphering Key
Sequence Number* information element is to make it possible for the
network to identify the ciphering key CK and integrity key IK which are
stored in the MS without invoking the authentication procedure. CK and
IK form a Key Set Identifier (KSI) (see 3GPP TS 33.102 \[5a\]) which is
encoded the same as the CKSN and is therefore included in the CKSN
field.

The ciphering key sequence number is a type 1 information element.

#### 10.5.1.3 Location Area Identification

The purpose of the *Location Area Identification* information element is
to provide an unambiguous identification of location areas within the
area covered by the 3GPP system.

The *Location Area Identification* information element is coded as shown
in figure 10.5.3/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.3/3GPP TS 24.008.

The *Location Area Identification* is a type 3 information element with
6 octets length.

| The MCC field is coded as in ITU-T Rec. E212, Annex A.                |
|                                                                       |
| If the LAI is deleted the MCC and MNC shall take the value from the   |
| deleted LAI.                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| In abnormal cases, the MCC stored in the mobile station can contain   |
| elements not in the set {0, 1 \... 9}. In such cases the mobile       |
| station should transmit the stored values using full hexadecimal      |
| encoding. When receiving such an MCC, the network shall treat the LAI |
| as deleted.                                                           |
|                                                                       |

| The coding of this field is the responsibility of each administration |
| but BCD coding shall be used. The MNC shall consist of 2 or 3 digits. |
| For PCS 1900 for NA, Federal regulation mandates that a 3-digit MNC   |
| shall be used. However a network operator may decide to use only two  |
| digits in the MNC in the LAI over the radio interface. In this case,  |
| bits 5 to 8 of octet 3 shall be coded as \"1111\". Mobile equipment   |
| shall accept LAI coded in such a way.                                 |
|                                                                       |
| NOTE 1: In earlier versions of this protocol, the possibility to use  |
| a one digit MNC in LAI was provided on the radio interface. However   |
| as this was not used this possibility has been deleted.               |
|                                                                       |
| NOTE 2: In earlier versions of this protocol, bits 5 to 8 of octet 3  |
| were coded as \"1111\". Mobile equipment compliant with these earlier |
| versions of the protocol may be unable to understand the 3-digit MNC  |
| format of the LAI, and therefore unable to register on a network      |
| broadcasting the LAI in this format.                                  |
|                                                                       |
| In abnormal cases, the MNC stored in the mobile station can have:     |
|                                                                       |
| \- digit 1 or 2 not in the set {0, 1 \... 9}, or                      |
|                                                                       |
| \- digit 3 not in the set {0, 1 \... 9, F} hex.                       |
|                                                                       |
| In such cases the mobile station shall transmit the stored values     |
| using full hexadecimal encoding. When receiving such an MNC, the      |
| network shall treat the LAI as deleted.                               |
|                                                                       |
| The same handling shall apply for the network, if a 3-digit MNC is    |
| sent by the mobile station to a network using only a 2-digit MNC.     |
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |
| The coding of the location area code is the responsibility of each    |
| administration except that two values are used to mark the LAC, and   |
| hence the LAI, as deleted. Coding using full hexadecimal              |

| Equipment with the location area code containing all zeros, then the  |
| Mobile Equipment shall recognise this LAC as part of a deleted LAI    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

#### 10.5.1.4 Mobile Identity

The purpose of the *Mobile Identity* information element is to provide
either the international mobile subscriber identity, IMSI, the temporary
mobile subscriber identity, TMSI/P-TMSI/M-TMSI, the international mobile
equipment identity, IMEI, the international mobile equipment identity
together with the software version number, IMEISV, or the temporary
mobile group identity (TMGI), associated with the optional MBMS Session
Identity.

The IMSI shall not exceed 15 digits, the TMSI/P-TMSI/M-TMSI is 4 octets
long, and the IMEI is composed of 15 digits, the IMEISV is 16 digits
(see 3GPP TS 23.003 \[10\]). The TMGI is at maximum 6 octets long and is
defined in subclause 10.5.6.13. The MBMS Session Identity, if included,
is 1 octet long (see 3GPP TS 48.018 \[86\]).

For packet paging the network shall select the mobile identity type with
the following priority:

1- P-TMSI: The P-TMSI shall be used if it is available.

2- IMSI: The IMSI shall be used in cases where no P-TMSI is available.

For MBMS (pre-)notification (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[84\] and 3GPP TS
44.060 \[76\]) the network shall select the mobile identity type \"TMGI
and optional MBMS Session Identity\".

NOTE 1: The type of identity \"TMGI and optional MBMS Session Identity\"
is only used by the MBMS (pre‑)notification procedure in of A/Gb mode.

For all other transactions with the following exceptions:

\- emergency call establishment, emergency call re-establishment, mobile
terminated call establishment, the identification procedure, the GMM
identification procedure, the GMM authentication, GPRS attach, routing
area updating, and ciphering procedure and the ciphering mode setting
procedure; and

\- location updating when the MS is configured for \"AttachWithIMSI\" as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 \[135\] or 3GPP TS 31.102 \[112\] and the
selected PLMN is neither the registered PLMN nor in the list of
equivalent PLMNs;

the mobile station and the network shall select the mobile identity type
with the following priority:

1- TMSI: The TMSI shall be used if it is available.

2- IMSI: The IMSI shall be used in cases where no TMSI is available.

For mobile terminated call establishment the mobile station shall select
the same mobile identity type as received from the network in the PAGING
REQUEST message. In case of enhanced DTM CS establishment (see 3GPP TS
44.018 \[84\]) the mobile station shall select the mobile identity type
with the following priority in the PAGING RESPONSE message:

1- TMSI: The TMSI shall be used if it is available.

2- IMSI: The IMSI shall be used in cases where no TMSI is available.

For the PAGING RESPONSE message sent as a response to a paging for CS
fallback, the MS shall:

\- select the TMSI as mobile identity type if the network has, in
E-UTRAN,

\- paged the MS for CS fallback using the S-TMSI; or

\- indicated TMSI in the CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message (see
3GPP TS 24.301 \[120\]);

\- select the IMSI as mobile identity type if the network has, in
E-UTRAN,

\- paged the MS for CS fallback using the IMSI; or

\- indicated IMSI in the CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message (see
3GPP TS 24.301 \[120\]).

For emergency call establishment and re-establishment the mobile station
shall select the mobile identity type with the following priority:

1- TMSI: The TMSI shall be used if it is available and if the location
update status is UPDATED, and the stored LAI is equal to the one
received on the BCCH from the current serving cell.

2- IMSI: The IMSI shall be used in cases where no TMSI is available or
TMSI is available but either the update status is different from
UPDATED, or the stored LAI is different from the one received on the
BCCH from the current serving cell.

3- IMEI: The IMEI shall be used in cases where no SIM/USIM is available
or the SIM/USIM is considered as not valid by the mobile station or no
IMSI or TMSI is available.

In the identification procedure and in the GMM identification procedure
the mobile station shall select the mobile identity type which was
requested by the network, if available. If the requested identity is not
available, then the mobile station shall indicate the identity type \"No
Identity\".

In the ciphering mode setting procedure and in the GMM authentication
and ciphering procedure the mobile shall select the IMEISV.

The *Mobile Identity* information element is coded as shown in figure
10.5.4/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.4/3GPP TS 24.008.

The *Mobile Identity* is a type 4 information element with a minimum
length of 3 octet and 11 octets length maximal. Further restriction on
the length may be applied, e.g. number plans.

#### 10.5.1.5 Mobile Station Classmark 1

The purpose of the *Mobile Station Classmark 1* information element is
to provide the network with information concerning aspects of high
priority of the mobile station equipment. This affects the manner in
which the network handles the operation of the mobile station. The
Mobile Station Classmark information indicates general mobile station
characteristics and it shall therefore, except for fields explicitly
indicated, be independent of the frequency band of the channel it is
sent on.

The *Mobile Station Classmark 1* information element is coded as shown
in figure 10.5.5/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.5/3GPP TS 24.008.

The *Mobile Station Classmark 1* is a type 3 information element with 2
octets length.

#### 10.5.1.6 Mobile Station Classmark 2

The purpose of the *Mobile Station Classmark 2* information element is
to provide the network with information concerning aspects of both high
and low priority of the mobile station equipment. This affects the
manner in which the network handles the operation of the mobile station.
The Mobile Station Classmark information indicates general mobile
station characteristics and it shall therefore, except for fields
explicitly indicated, be independent of the frequency band of the
channel it is sent on.

The *Mobile Station Classmark 2* information element is coded as shown
in figure 10.5.6/3GPP TS 24.008, table 10.5.6a/3GPP TS 24.008 and
table 10.5.6b/3GPP TS 24.008.

The *Mobile Station Classmark 2* is a type 4 information element with 5
octets length.

NOTE 2: Additional mobile station capability information might be
obtained by invoking the classmark interrogation procedure when GSM is
used.

#### 10.5.1.7 Mobile Station Classmark 3

The purpose of the *Mobile Station Classmark 3* information element is
to provide the network with information concerning aspects of the mobile
station. The contents might affect the manner in which the network
handles the operation of the mobile station. The Mobile Station
Classmark information indicates general mobile station characteristics
and it shall therefore, except for fields explicitly indicated, be
independent of the frequency band of the channel it is sent on.

The *Mobile Station Classmark 3* is a type 4 information element with a
maximum of 34 octets length.

The value part of a *Mobile Station Classmark 3* information element is
coded as shown in figure 10.5.1.7/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.1.7/3GPP
TS 24.008.

NOTE: The 34 octet limit is so that the CLASSMARK CHANGE message will
fit in up to two layer 2 frames.

SEMANTIC RULE: a multiband mobile station shall provide information
about all frequency bands it can support. A single band mobile station
shall not indicate the band it supports in the *Multiband Supported, GSM
400 Bands Supported, GSM 710 Associated Radio Capability, GSM 750
Associated Radio Capability, T-GSM 810 Associated Radio Capability, GSM
850 Associated Radio Capability or GSM 1900 Associated Radio Capability*
fields in the *Mobile Station Classmark 3*. Due to shared radio
frequency channel numbers between GSM 1800 and GSM 1900, the mobile
should indicate support for either GSM 1800 band OR GSM 1900 band.

SEMANTIC RULE: a mobile station shall include the MS Measurement
Capability field if the *Multi Slot Class* field contains a value of 19
or greater (see 3GPP TS 45.002 \[32\]).

Typically, the number of spare bits at the end is the minimum to reach
an octet boundary. The receiver may add any number of bits set to \"0\"

MS with actual parameter settings of system information parameters
controlling MM and GMM functionality. The Core Network system
information is included in specific information elements within some RRC
messages sent to MS, see 3GPP TS 25.331 \[23c\].

NOTE: These IEs do not have an IEI or a length indicator, because these
IEs are never present in any layer 3 messages, Hence these IEs do not
conform to the general IE rules defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 \[20\].

#### 10.5.3.5 Location updating type

The purpose of the *Location Updating Type* information element is to
indicate whether a normal updating, a periodic updating or an IMSI
attach is wanted. It may also indicate that a follow-on request has been
received from the mobile station CM layer.

The *Location Updating Type* information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.79/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.93/3GPP TS 24.008.

#### 10.5.3.5a Network Name

The purpose of this information element is to pass a text string to the
mobile station.

The *Network Name* information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.80/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.94/3GPP TS 24.008.

If the coding scheme UCS2 is used and Chinese-Japanese-Korean-Vietnamese
(CJKV) ideographs as defined in ISO/IEC 10646 \[72\] are received in the
text string, the MS shall use the MCC of the PLMN from which it received
the network name information element to determine the language for those
CJKV ideographs as specified in table 10.5.93a/3GPP TS 24.008:

Table 10.5.93a/3GPP TS 24.008: MCC to CJKV ideograph language mapping
table

  ---------------------------------------------
  MCC(s)     Country/Region   Language\
                              (C, J, K, or V)
  ---------- ---------------- -----------------
  460, 461   Mainland China   Chinese-G

  466        Taiwan           Chinese-T

  454        HongKong         Chinese-T

  455        Macao            Chinese-T

  440, 441   Japan            J (Kanji)

  450, 467   Korea            K (Hanja)

  452        Vietnam          V (Chunom)
  ---------------------------------------------

NOTE: This is due to CJKV ideograph language ambiguity in UCS2, in the
sense that the same hexadecimal code can be mapped to different
character displays dependent on the used language. The coding of CJKV
ideographs itself does not allow to discriminate the CJKV ideograph
language.

The *Network Name* is a type 4 information element with a minimum length
of 3 octets. No upper length limit is specified except for that given by
the maximum number of octets in a L3 message (see 3GPP TS 44.006
\[19\]).

#### 10.5.3.6 Reject cause

The purpose of the *Reject Cause* information element is to indicate the
reason why a request from the mobile station is rejected by the network.

The *Reject Cause* information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.81/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.95/3GPP TS 24.008.

The *Reject Cause* is a type 3 information element with 2 octets length.

### 10.5.4 Call control information elements

#### 10.5.4.1 Extensions of codesets

There is a certain number of possible information element identifier
values using the formatting rules described in subclause 10.5: 128 from
the type 3 & 4 information element format and at least 8 from the type 1
& 2 information element format.

One value in the type 1 format is specified for shift operations
described below. One other value in both the type 3 & 4 and type 1
format is reserved. This leaves 133 information element identifier
values available for assignment.

It is possible to expand this structure to eight codesets of 133
information element identifier values each. One common value in the type
1 format is employed in each codeset to facilitate shifting from one
codeset to another. The contents of this shift information element
identifies the codeset to be used for the next information element or
elements. The codeset in use at any given time is referred to as the
\"active codeset\". By convention, codeset 0 is the initially active
codeset.

Two codeset shifting procedures are supported: locking shift and
non-locking shift.

Codeset 5 is reserved for information elements reserved for national
use.

Codeset 6 is reserved for information elements specific to the local
network (either public or private).

Codeset 7 is reserved for user-specific information elements.

The coding rules specified in subclause 10.5 shall apply for information
elements belonging to any active codeset.

The mobile station and the network shall not apply the \"comprehension
required\" scheme (see 3GPP TS 24.007 \[20\]) to information elements
belonging to codesets different from codeset 0.

IEIs with bits 5, 6, 7 and 8 all set to zero should not be allocated for
new optional information elements in codesets different from codeset 0,
because there are legacy mobile stations that apply the \"comprehension
required\" scheme also to these information elements, e.g. if such a
mobile station receives a SETUP message containing an unknown
information element from codeset 5 with an IEI with bits 5, 6, 7 and 8
all set to zero, then the mobile station will release the call.

Transitions from one active codeset to another (i.e. by means of the
locking shift procedure) may only be made to a codeset with a higher
numerical value than the codeset being left.

An information element belonging to codeset 5, 6 or 7 may appear
together with information elements belonging to codeset 0, by using the
non-locking shift procedure (see subclause 10.5.4.3).

A user or network equipment shall have the capability to recognize a
shift information element and to determine the length of the following
information element, although the equipment need not be able to
interpret and act on the content of the information element. This
enables the equipment to determine the start of the subsequent
information element.

#### 10.5.4.2 Locking shift procedure

The locking shift procedure employs an information element to indicate
the new active codeset. The specified codeset remains active until
another locking shift information element is encountered which specifies
the use of another codeset. For example, codeset 0 is active at the
start of message content analysis. If a locking shift to codeset 5 is
encountered, the next information elements will be interpreted according
to the information element identifiers assigned in codeset 5, until
another shift information element is encountered. This procedure is used
only to shift to a higher order codeset than the one being left.

The locking shift is valid only within that message which contains the
locking shift information element. At the start of every message content
analysis, the active codeset is codeset 0.

The locking shift information element uses the type 1 information
element format and coding shown in figure 10.5.85/3GPP TS 24.008 and
table 10.5.98/3GPP TS 24.008.

#### 10.5.4.3 Non-locking shift procedure

The non-locking shift procedure provides a temporary shift to the
specified lower or higher codeset. The non-locking shift procedure uses
a type 1 information element to indicate the codeset to be used to
interpret the next information element. After the interpretation of the
next information element, the active codeset is again used for
interpreting any following information elements. For example, codeset 0
is active at the beginning of message content analysis. If a non-locking
shift to codeset 6 is encountered, only the next information element is
interpreted according to the information element identifiers assigned in
codeset 6. After this information element is interpreted, codeset 0 will
again be used to interpret the following information elements. A
non-locking shift information element indicating the current codeset
shall not be regarded as an error.

A locking shift information element shall not follow directly a
non-locking shift information element. If this combination is received,
it shall be interpreted as though a locking shift information element
had been received.

The non-locking shift information element uses the type 1 information
format and coding shown in figure 10.5.86/3GPP TS 24.008 and
table 10.5.99/3GPP TS 24.008.

#### 10.5.4.4 Auxiliary states

The purpose of the auxiliary states information element is to describe
the current status of the auxiliary states of a call in the call control
states \"active\" and \"mobile originating modify\" (see
3GPP TS 24.083 \[27\] and 3GPP TS 24.084 \[28\]).

The auxiliary states information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.87/3GPP TS 24.008, table 10.5.100/3GPP TS 24.008 and
table 10.5.101/3GPP TS 24.008.

The auxiliary states is a type 4 information element with 3 octets
length.

transparent\".

#### 10.5.4.5 Bearer capability

The purpose of the bearer capability information element is to describe
a bearer service. The use of the bearer capability information element
in relation to compatibility checking is described in annex B.

The bearer capability information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.88/3GPP TS 24.008 and tables 10.5.102/3GPP TS 24.008 to
10.5.115/3GPP TS 24.008.

The bearer capability is a type 4 information element with a minimum
length of 3 octets and a maximum length of 16 octets.

Figure 10.5.88/3GPP TS 24.008 Bearer capability information element

NOTE 1: The coding of the octets of the bearer capability information
element is not conforming to ITU Recommendation Q.931 \[53\].

An MS shall encode the Bearer Capability infomation element according to
A/Gb mode call control requirements also if it is requesting for a
service in Iu mode, with the following exceptions:

1\. A mobile station not supporting A/Gb mode and GERAN Iu mode for the
requested bearer service shall set the following parameters to the value
\"0\":\
- Maximum number of traffic channels (octet 6e, bits 1-3)\
- Acceptable Channel coding(s) (octet 6e, bits 4, 5 and 7)

2\. Furthermore, a mobile station not supporting A/Gb mode and GERAN Iu
mode for the requested bearer service shall also set the following
parameters to the value \"0\", if the respective octets have to be
included in the bearer capability information element according to
subclause 10.5.4.5.1 and 3GPP TS 27.001 \[36\]:\
- UIMI, User initiated modification indication (octet 6f, bits 5-7)\
- Acceptable Channel Codings extended (octet 6g, bits 5-7)

For UTRAN Iu mode the following parameters are irrelevant for specifying
the radio access bearer, because multiple traffic channels (multislot)
are not deployed, see 3GPP TS 23.034 \[104\]. However, the parameters if
received, shall be stored in the MSC, and used for handover to A/Gb or
GERAN Iu mode:\
- Maximum number of traffic channels (octet 6e, bits 1-3)\
- Acceptable Channel coding(s) (octet 6e, bits 4, 5 and 7)\
- UIMI, User initiated modification indication (octet 6f, bits 5-7)\
- Acceptable Channel Codings extended (octet 6g, bits 5-7)

NOTE 2: The following parameters are relevant in UTRAN Iu mode for non
transparent data calls for deciding which RLP version to negotiate in
order to avoid renegotiation of RLP version in case of inter-system
handover from UTRAN Iu mode to A/Gb or GERAN Iu mode, see 3GPP TS 24.022
\[141\]:\
- Maximum number of traffic channels (octet 6e, bits 1-3)\
- Wanted air interface user rate (octet 6f, bits 1- 4)\
- UIMI, User initiated modification indication (octet 6f, bits 5-7).

##### 10.5.4.5.1 Static conditions for the bearer capability IE contents

If the information transfer capability field (octet 3) indicates
\"speech\", octets 4, 5, 5a, 5b, 6, 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 6f, 6g and 7
shall not be included.

If the information transfer capability field (octet 3) indicates
\"speech\", octet 3a etc. shall be included only if the mobile station
supports CTM text telephony or if it supports at least one speech
version for GERAN other than:

‑ GSM full rate speech version 1; or

‑ GSM half rate speech version 1.

If the information transfer capability field (octet 3) indicates a value
different from \"speech\", octets 4, 5, 6, 6a, 6b, and 6c shall be
included, octets 6d, 6e, 6f and 6g are optional. In the network to MS
direction in case octet 6d is included, octets 6e, 6f and 6g may be
included. In the MS to network direction in case octet 6d is included
octet 6e shall also be included and 6f and 6g may be included.

If the information transfer capability field (octet 3) indicates
\"facsimile group 3\", the modem type field (octet 6c) shall indicate
\"none\".

If the information transfer capability field (octet 3) indicates \"other
ITC\" or the rate adaption field (octet 5) indicates \"other rate
adaption\", octet 5a shall be included.

If the rate adaption field (octet 5) indicates \"other rate adaption\"
and the other rate adaption field (octet 5a) indicates \"V.120\", octet
5b shall be included.

The modem type field (octet 6c) shall not indicate \"autobauding type
1\" unless the connection element field (octet 6c) indicates \"non
transparent\".

#### 10.5.4.5a Call Control Capabilities

The purpose of the Call Control Capabilities information element is to
identify the call control capabilities of the mobile station.

The Call Control Capabilities information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.89/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.116/3GPP TS 24.008.

The Call Control Capabilities is a type 4 information element with a
length of 4 octets.

#### 10.5.4.6 Call state

The purpose of the call state information element is to describe the
current status of a call, (see subclause 5.1).

The call state information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.90/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.117/3GPP TS 24.008.

The call state is a type 3 information element with 2 octets length.

Figure 10.5.91/3GPP TS 24.008 Called party BCD number information
element

NOTE 1: The number digit(s) in octet 4 precedes the digit(s) in octet 5
etc. The number digit which would be entered first is located in octet
4, bits 1 to 4.

NOTE 2: If the called party BCD number contains an odd number of digits,
bits 5 to 8 of the last octet shall be filled with an end mark coded as
\"1111\".

Since the information element must contain the complete called party BCD
number there is no need for an additional complete indication.

NOTE 1: For the definition of \"number\" see ITU-T Recommendation
I.330 \[48\] and 3GPP TS 23.003 \[10\].

NOTE 2: The type of number \"unknown\" is used when the user or the
network has no knowledge of the type of number, e.g. international
number, national number, etc. In this case the number digits field is
organized according to the network dialling plan, e.g. prefix or escape
digits might be present.

NOTE 3: Prefix or escape digits shall not be included.

NOTE 4: The type of number \"network specific number\" is used to
indicate administration/service number specific to the serving network,
e.g. used to access an operator.

NOTE 5: The international format shall be accepted by the MSC when the
call is destined to a destination in the same country as the MSC.

#### 10.5.4.11 Cause

The purpose of the cause information element is to describe the reason
for generating certain messages, to provide diagnostic information in
the event of procedural errors and to indicate the location of the cause
originator.

The cause information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.95/3GPP
TS 24.008 and tables 10.5.122 and 10.5.123/3GPP TS 24.008.

The cause is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 4
octets and a maximum length of 32 octets.

The cause information element may be repeated in a message.

All other values in the range 0 to 31 shall be treated as cause 31.

All other values in the range 32 to 47 shall be treated as cause 47.

All other values in the range 48 to 63 shall be treated as cause 63.

All other values in the range 64 to 79 shall be treated as cause 79.

All other values in the range 80 to 95 shall be treated as cause 95.

All other values in the range 96 to 111 shall be treated as cause 111.

All other values in the range 112 to 127 shall be treated as cause 127.

NOTE 1: Diagnostics for supplementary services are handled as follows:

octet 5, bit 8:

This is an extension bit as defined in the preliminary part of
subclause 10.5. In this version of this protocol, this bit shall be set
to 1. If it is set to zero, the contents of the following octets shall
be ignored.

octet 5, bit 7-1:

0000001 - Outgoing calls barred within CUG

0000010 - No CUG selected

0000011 - Unknown CUG index

0000100 - CUG index incompatible with requested basic service

0000101 - CUG call failure, unspecified

0000110 - CLIR not subscribed

0000111 - CCBS possible

0001000 - CCBS not possible

All other values shall be ignored.

NOTE 2: The incompatible parameter is composed of the incompatible
information element identifier.

NOTE 3: The format of the diagnostic field for cause numbers 57, 58 and
65 is as shown in figure 10.5.88/3GPP TS 24.008 and tables 10.5.102/3GPP
TS 24.008 to 10.5.115/3GPP TS 24.008.

NOTE 4: The user supplied diagnostics field is encoded according to the
user specification, subject to the maximum length of the cause
information element. The coding of user supplied diagnostics should be
made in such a way that it does not conflict with the coding described
in note 9 below.

NOTE 5: The new destination is formatted as the called party BCD number
information element, including information element identifier.

NOTE 6: Locking and non-locking shift procedures described in
subclause 10.5.4.2 and clause 3 are applied. In principle, information
element identifiers are ordered in the same order as the information
elements in the received message.

NOTE 7: When only the locking shift information element is included and
no information element identifier follows, it means that the codeset in
the locking shift itself is not implemented.

NOTE 8: The timer number is coded in IA5 characters, e.g., T308 is coded
as \"3\" \"0\" \"8\". The following coding is used in each octet:

bit 8: spare \"0\"

bits 7-1: IA5 character

Octet 5 carries \"3\", octet 5a carries \"0\", etc.

NOTE 9: The following coding is used for octet 5:

bit 8 : 1

bits 7-3: 00000

bits 2-1: condition as follows:

00 - unknown

01 - permanent

10 - transient

#### 10.5.4.16 High layer compatibility

The purpose of the high layer compatibility information element is to
provide a means which should be used by the remote user for
compatibility checking. See annex B.

The high layer compatibility information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.102/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.125/3GPP TS 24.008.

The high layer compatibility is a type 4 information element with a
minimum length of 2 octets and a maximum length of 5 octets.

NOTE: The high layer compatibility information element is transported
transparently by a PLMN between a call originating entity (e.g. a
calling user) and the addressed entity (e.g. a remote user or a high
layer function network node addressed by the call originating entity).
However, if explicitly requested by the user (at subscription time), a
network which provides some capabilities to realize teleservices may
interpret this information to provide a particular service.

#### 10.5.4.18 Low layer compatibility

The purpose of the low layer compatibility information element is to
provide a means which should be used for compatibility checking by an
addressed entity (e.g., a remote user or an interworking unit or a high
layer function network node addressed by the calling user). The low
layer compatibility information element is transferred transparently by
a PLMN between the call originating entity (e.g. the calling user) and
the addressed entity.

Except for the information element identifier, the low layer
compatibility information element is coded as in ITU recommendation
Q.931.

For backward compatibility reasons coding of the modem type field
according to ETS 300 102-1 (12-90) shall also be supported.

The low layer compatibility is a type 4 information element with a
minimum length of 2 octets and a maximum length of 18 octets.

*Redirecting party subaddress* information element

#### 10.5.4.22 Repeat indicator

The purpose of the repeat indicator information element is to indicate
how the associated repeated information elements shall be interpreted,
when included in a message. The repeat indicator information element is
included immediately before the first occurrence of the associated
information element which will be repeated in a message. \"Mode 1\"
refers to the first occurrence of that information element, \"mode 2\"
refers to the second occurrence of that information element in the same
message.

The repeat indicator information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.109/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.129/3GPP TS 24.008.

The repeat indicator is a type 1 information element.

NOTE: Usually, this information element has only one octet of content.

#### 10.5.4.25 User-user

The purpose of the user-user information element is to convey
information between the mobile station and the remote ISDN user.

The user-user information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.114/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.131/ 3GPP TS 24.008. There
are no restrictions on the content of the user-user information field.

The user-user is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 3
octets and a maximum length of either 35 or 131 octets. In the SETUP
message the user-user information element has a maximum size of 35
octets in a GSM PLMN. In the USER INFORMATION, ALERTING, CONNECT,
DISCONNECT, PROGRESS, RELEASE and RELEASE COMPLETE messages the
user-user information element has a maximum size of 131 octets in a
GSM PLMN.

In other networks than GSM PLMNs the maximum size of the user-user
information element is 35 or 131 octets in the messages mentioned above.
The evolution to a single maximum value is the long term objective; the
exact maximum value is the subject of further study.

NOTE: The user-user information element is transported transparently
through a GSM PLMN.

#### 10.5.4.26 Alerting Pattern \$(NIA)\$

The purpose of the Alerting Pattern information element is to allow the
network to convey information related to the alert to be used by the MS
(see 3GPP TS 22.101 \[8\]).

The Alerting Pattern information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.115/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.132/3GPP TS 24.008.

The Alerting Pattern IE is a type 4 information element with 3 octet
length.

Emergency Service Category Value (octet 3)

The meaning of the Emergency Category Value is derived from the
following settings (see 3GPP TS 22.101 \[8\] clause 10):

Bit 1 Police

Bit 2 Ambulance

Bit 3 Fire Brigade

Bit 4 Marine Guard

Bit 5 Mountain Rescue

Bit 6 manually initiated eCall

Bit 7 automatically initiated eCall

Bit 8 is spare and set to \"0\"

A mobile station not initiating an eCall shall set bit 6 and bit 7 to
\"0\" and may set one or more of bit 1, bit 2, bit 3, bit 4 or bit 5 to
\"1\". If more than one of these bits is set to \"1\", routing to a
combined emergency centre (e.g. ambulance and fire brigade in Japan) is
required.

A mobile station initiating an eCall shall set either bit 6 or bit 7 to
\"1\" and shall set all other bits to \"0\". A MSC supporting eCall
shall use the information indicated in bit 6 and bit 7 to route the
manually or automatically initiated eCall to an operator defined
emergency call centre.

If the MSC can not match the received service category to any of the
emergency centres, or if no bit is set to \"1\", the MSC shall route the
emergency call to an operator defined default emergency centre.

#### 10.5.5.12 MS network capability

The purpose of the *MS network capability* information element is to
provide the network with information concerning aspects of the mobile
station related to GPRS. The contents might affect the manner in which
the network handles the operation of the mobile station. The *MS network
capability* information indicates general mobile station characteristics
and it shall therefore, except for fields explicitly indicated, be
independent of the frequency band of the channel it is sent on.

The *MS network capability* is a type 4 information element with a
maximum of 10 octets length.

The value part of a *MS network capability*information element is coded
as shown in figure 10.5.128/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.145/3GPP TS
24.008.

NOTE: The requirements for the support of the GEA algorithms in the MS
are specified in 3GPP TS 43.020 \[13\].

#### 10.5.5.12a MS Radio Access capability

The purpose of the *MS Radio Access capability* information element is
to provide the radio part of the network with information concerning
radio aspects of the mobile station. The contents might affect the
manner in which the network handles the operation of the mobile station.

The *MS Radio Access capability* is a type 4 information element, with a
maximum length of 52 octets.

The *MS Radio Access capability* information element is coded as shown
in figure 10.5.128a/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.146/3GPP TS 24.008.

For the indication of the radio access capabilities the following
conditions shall apply:

\- Among the three Access Type Technologies GSM 900-P, GSM 900-E and GSM
900-R only one shall be present.

\- Due to shared radio frequency channel numbers between GSM 1800 and
GSM 1900, the mobile station should provide the relevant radio access
capability for either GSM 1800 band OR GSM 1900 band, not both.

\- The MS shall indicate its supported Access Technology Types during a
single MM procedure.

\- If the alternative coding by using the Additional access technologies
struct is chosen by the mobile station, the mobile station shall
indicate its radio access capability for the serving BCCH frequency band
in the first included Access capabilities struct, if this information
element is not sent in response to an Access Technologies Request from
the network or if none of the requested Access Technology Types is
supported by the MS. Otherwise, the mobile station shall include the
radio access capabilities for the frequency bands it supports in the
order of priority requested by the network (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[76\]).

\- The first Access Technology Type shall not be set to \"1111\".

For error handling the following shall apply:

− If a received Access Technology Type is unknown to the receiver, it
shall ignore all the corresponding fields.

− If within a known Access Technology Type a receiver recognizes an
unknown field it shall ignore it.

− For more details about error handling of MS radio access capability
see 3GPP TS 48.018 \[86\].

NOTE: The requirements for the support of the A5 algorithms in the MS
are specified in 3GPP TS 43.020 \[13\].

#### 10.5.5.15 Routing area identification

The purpose of the *routing area identification* information element is
to provide an unambiguous identification of routing areas within the
GPRS coverage area.

The *routing area identification* is a type 3 information element with 7
octets length.

The *routing area identification* information element is coded as shown
in figure 10.5.130/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.148/3GPP TS 24.008.

| MCC, Mobile country code (octet 2 and 3)                              |
|                                                                       |
| The MCC field is coded as in ITU-T Rec. E212, Annex A.                |
|                                                                       |
| If the RAI is deleted, the MCC and MNC shall take the value from the  |
| deleted RAI.                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| In abnormal cases, the MCC stored in the mobile station can contain   |
| elements not in the set {0, 1 \... 9}. In such cases the mobile       |
| station should transmit the stored values using full hexadecimal      |
| encoding. When receiving such an MCC, the network shall treat the RAI |
| as deleted.                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| MNC, Mobile network code (octet 3 bits 5 to 8, octet 4)               |
|                                                                       |
| The coding of this field is the responsibility of each administration |
| but BCD coding shall be used. The MNC shall consist of 2 or 3 digits. |
| For PCS 1900 for NA, Federal regulation mandates that a 3-digit MNC   |
| shall be used. However a network operator may decide to use only two  |
| digits in the MNC in the RAI over the radio interface. In this case,  |
| bits 5 to 8 of octet 3 shall be coded as \"1111\". Mobile equipment   |
| shall accept RAI coded in such a way.                                 |
|                                                                       |
| NOTE 1: In earlier versions of this protocol, the possibility to use  |
| a one digit MNC in RAI was provided on the radio interface. However   |
| as this was not used this possibility has been deleted.               |
|                                                                       |
| NOTE 2: In earlier versions of this protocol, bits 5 to 8 of octet 3  |
| were coded as \"1111\". Mobile equipment compliant with these earlier |
| versions of the protocol may be unable to understand the 3-digit MNC  |

| In such cases the mobile station shall transmit the stored values     |

| The coding of the location area code is the responsibility of each    |

| If a RAI has to be deleted then all bits of the location area code    |
| shall be set to one with the exception of the least significant bit   |
| which shall be set to zero. If a SIM/USIM is inserted in a Mobile     |
| Equipment with the location area code containing all zeros, then the  |

#### 10.5.5.24 Inter RAT information container

The purpose of the *Inter RAT information container* information element
is to supply the network with Iu mode related information that needs to
be transferred at PS inter-system handover to Iu mode (see 3GPP TS
43.129 \[113\]).

The *Inter RAT information container* information element is coded as
shown in figure 10.5.150/3GPP TS 24.008.

The *Inter RAT information container* information element is a type 4
information element with a minimum length of 3 octets and a maximum
length of 250 octets.

The Inter RAT information container contains:

\- predefined configuration status information;

\- mobile station security information to be used after handover to Iu
mode, which includes the START-PS value that is stored by the MS at
handover from Iu mode to A/Gb mode (see 3GPP TS 33.102 \[5a\]); and/or

\- the specific Iu mode radio capabilities of the mobile station, i.e.
UE RAC (see 3GPP TS 25.331 \[23c\]).

The value part of the *Inter RAT information container* information
element is the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO as defined in 3GPP TS 25.331
\[23c\]. If this field includes padding bits, they are defined in
3GPP TS 25.331 \[23c\].

#### 10.5.5.25 Requested MS information

The purpose of the *Requested MS information* information element is to
indicate whether certain feature-related information is requested from
the MS by the network. If this IE is not included then no information is
requested.

The *Requested MS information* information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.151/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.166/3GPP TS 24.008.

The *Requested MS information* is a type 1 information element.

#### 10.5.5.26 UE network capability

See subclause 9.9.3.34 in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[120\].

#### 10.5.5.27 E-UTRAN inter RAT information container

The purpose of the *E-UTRAN* *inter RAT information container*
information element is to supply the network with E-UTRAN related
information that needs to be transferred at Inter-RAT PS handover to
E-UTRAN (see 3GPP TS 23.401 \[122\]).

The *E-UTRAN* *inter RAT information container* information element is
coded as shown in figure 10.5.151/3GPP TS 24.008.

The *E-UTRAN* *inter RAT information container* information element is a
type 4 information element with a minimum length of 3 octets and an
upper length limit of 257 octets.

Figure 10.5.151/3GPP TS 24.008: *E-UTRAN* *inter RAT information
container* information element

The value part of the *E-UTRAN* *inter RAT information container*
information element is formatted and coded according to the
*UE-EUTRA-Capability* IE defined in 3GPP TS 36.331 \[129\].

#### 10.5.5.28 Voice domain preference and UE\'s usage setting

The purpose of the *Voice domain preference and UE\'s usage setting*
information element is to provide the network with the UE\'s usage
setting and the voice domain preference for WB-S1 mode. The network uses
the UE\'s usage setting and the voice domain preference for E-UTRAN (see
3GPP TS 24.167 \[13B\]) only to select the RFSP index.

The UE\'s usage setting bit indicates the value configured on the ME as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.221 \[131\].

The voice domain preference for E-UTRAN bit indicates the value
configured on the ME of the Voice domain preference for E-UTRAN as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.167 \[134\].

The *Voice domain preference and UE\'s usage setting* information
element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.151A/3GPP TS 24.008 and
table 10.5.166A/3GPP TS 24.008.

#### 10.5.5.32 Extended DRX parameters

The purpose of the *Extended DRX parameters* information element is to
indicate that the MS wants to use eDRX and for the network to indicate
the Paging Time Window length value and the extended DRX cycle value to
be used for eDRX.

The *Extended DRX parameters* is a type 4 information element with a
length of 3 octets.

The *Extended DRX parameters* information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.5.32/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.5.32/3GPP TS 24.008.

| The *protocol identifier* field contains the hexadecimal coding of    |

| the *protocol identifier* field contains the most significant bit and |
| bit 1 of the second octet of the *protocol identifier* field contains |

| The *length of the protocol identifier contents* field contains the   |
| binary coded representation of the length of the *protocol identifier |
| contents* field of a unit. The first bit in transmission order is the |
| most significant bit.                                                 |

| The support of other protocol identifiers is implementation dependent |
| and outside the scope of the present document.                        |
|                                                                       |
| The *protocol identifier contents* field of each unit corresponds to  |
| a "Packet" as defined in RFC 1661 \[102\] that is stripped off the    |
| "Protocol" and the "Padding" octets.                                  |
|                                                                       |
| The detailed coding of the *protocol identifier contents* field is    |
| specified in the RFC that is associated with the protocol identifier  |
| of that unit.                                                         |

| The *additional parameters list* is included when special parameters  |
| and/or requests (associated with a PDP context) need to be            |
| transferred between the MS and the network. These parameters and/or   |
| requests are not related to a specific configuration protocol (e.g.   |
| PPP), and therefore are not encoded as the \"Packets\" contained in   |
| the *configuration protocol options list*.                            |
|                                                                       |
| The *additional parameters list* contains a list of special           |
| parameters, each one in a separate container. The type of the         |
| parameter carried in a container is identified by a specific          |
| *container identifier*. In this version of the protocol, the          |
| following container identifiers are specified:                        |

##### 10.5.6.3.3 Additional APN rate control parameters for exception data

The purpose of the *Additional* *APN rate control parameters for
exception data* container contents is to indicate the additional APN
rate control parameters for exception data.

The *Additional* *APN rate control parameters for exception data*
container contents are coded as shown in
figure 10.5.6.3.3-1/3GPP TS 24.008 and
table 10.5.6.3.3-1/3GPP TS 24.008.

The *Additional* *APN rate control parameters for exception data*
container contents can be 1 octet long or 3 octets long. If the
*Additional* *APN rate control parameters for exception data* container
contents is longer than 3 octets, the 4th octet and later octets are
ignored.

If PDP type number indicates IPv4, the Address information in octet 5 to
octet 8 contains the IPv4 address. Bit 8 of octet 5 represents the most
significant bit of the IP address and bit 1 of octet 8 the least
significant bit.

If PDP type number indicates IPv6, the Address information in octet 5 to
octet 20 contains the IPv6 address. Bit 8 of octet 5 represents the most
significant bit of the IP address and bit 1 of octet 20 the least
significant bit.

If PDP type number indicates IPv4v6:\
The Address information in octet 5 to octet 8 contains the IPv4 address.
Bit 8 of octet 5 represents the most significant bit of the IP address
and bit 1 of octet 8 the least significant bit.\
The Address information in octet 9 to octet 24 contains the IPv6
address. Bit 8 of octet 9 represents the most significant bit of the IP
address and bit 1 of octet 24 the least significant bit.

If PDP type number indicates IPv4 or IPv4v6 and DHCPv4 is to be used to
allocate the IPv4 address, the IPv4 address shall be coded as 0.0.0.0.

#### 10.5.6.5 Quality of service

The purpose of the *quality of service* information element is to
specify the QoS parameters for a PDP context.

The QoS IE is defined to allow backward compatibility to earlier version
of Session Management Protocol.

The *quality of service* is a type 4 information element with a minimum
length of 14 octets and a maximum length of 22 octets. The QoS requested
by the MS shall be encoded both in the QoS attributes specified in
octets 3-5 and in the QoS attributes specified in octets 6-14.

In the MS to network direction and in the network to MS direction the
following applies:

\- Octets 15-22 are optional. If octet 15 is included, then octet 16
shall also be included, and octets 17-22may be included.

the protocol.

In this version of the protocol, for messages specified in the present
document, the sending entity shall not request 0 kbps for both the
Maximum bitrate for downlink and the Maximum bitrate for uplink at the
same time. Any entity receiving a request for 0 kbps in both the Maximum

#### 10.5.6.12 Traffic Flow Template

The purpose of the *traffic flow template* information element is to
specify the TFT parameters and operations for a PDP context. In
addition, this information element may be used to transfer extra
parameters to the network (e.g. the Authorization Token; see 3GPP TS
24.229 \[95\]). The TFT may contain packet filters for the downlink
direction, the uplink direction or packet filters that are applicable to
both directions. The packet filters determine the traffic mapping to PDP
contexts. The downlink packet filters shall be used by the network and
the uplink packet filters shall be used by the MS. A packet filter that
is applicable to both directions shall be used by the network as a
downlink packet filter and by the MS as an uplink packet filter.

The *traffic flow template* is a type 4 information element with a
minimum length of 3 octets. The maximum length for the IE is 257 octets.

NOTE 1: The IE length restriction is due to the maximum length that can
be encoded in a single length octet.

NOTE 2: A maximum size IPv4 packet filter can be 32 bytes. Therefore, 7
maximum size IPv4 type packet filters, plus the last packet filter which
can contain max 30 octets can fit into one TFT IE, i.e. if needed not
all packet filter components can be defined into one message. A maximum
size IPv6 packet filter can be 60 bytes. Therefore, only 4 maximum size
IPv6 packet filters can fit into one TFT IE. However, using \"Add packet
filters to existing TFT\", it\'s possible to create a TFT data structure
including 16 maximum size IPv4 or IPv6 filters.

The *traffic flow template* information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.144/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.162/3GPP TS 24.008.

NOTE 3: The 3GPP TS 24.301 \[120\] reuses the *traffic flow template*
information element for the purpose of the traffic flow aggregate
description, where the use of individual TFT parameters, e.g. the packet
filter identifier in the parameter list, can differ from this
specification.

| When the *parameter identifier* indicates Authorization Token, the    |
| *parameter contents* field contains an authorization token, as        |
| specified in 3GPP TS 29.207 \[100\]. The first octet is the most      |
| significant octet of the authorization token and the last octet is    |
| the least significant octet of the authorization token.               |
|                                                                       |
| The *parameters list* shall be coded in a way that an Authorization   |
| Token (i.e. a parameter with identifier 01H) is always followed by    |
| one or more Flow Identifiers (i.e. one or more parameters with        |
| identifier 02H).                                                      |
|                                                                       |
| If the *parameters list* contains two or more consecutive             |
| Authorization Tokens without any Flow Identifiers in between, the     |
| receiver shall treat this as a semantical TFT error.                  |
|                                                                       |
| When the *parameter identifier* indicates Flow Identifier, the        |
| *parameter contents* field contains the binary representation of a    |
| flow identifier. The Flow Identifier consists of four octets. Octets  |
| 1 and 2 contains the Media Component number as specified in           |
| 3GPP TS 29.207 \[100\]. Bit 1 of octet 2 is the least significant     |
| bit, and bit 8 of octet 1 is the most significant bit. Octets 3 and 4 |
| contains the IP flow number as specified in 3GPP TS 29.207 \[100\].   |
| Bit 1 of octet 4 is the least significant bit, and bit 8 of octet 3   |
| is the most significant bit.                                          |
|                                                                       |
| When the *parameter identifier* indicates Packet Filter Identifier,   |
| the parameter contents field contains the binary representation of    |
| one or more packet filter identifiers. Each packet filter identifier  |
| is encoded in one octet, in the 4 least significant bits. This        |
| parameter is used by the MS and the network to identify one or more   |
| packet filters in a TFT when modifying the QoS of a PDP context       |
| without modifying the packet filter itself.                           |

#### 10.5.6.14 MBMS bearer capabilities 

The purpose of the *MBMS bearer capabilities* information element is to
indicate the maximum bit rate for downlink supported by the MS for an
MBMS context.

NOTE: The information element indicates the static physical capabilities
of the MS, independent of the radio access (UTRAN or GERAN), the radio
conditions, or other CS or PS services possibly activated by the MS.

The *MBMS bearer capabilities* is a type 4 information element with a
maximum length of 4 octets.

The *MBMS bearer capabilities* information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.155/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.169/3GPP TS 24.008.

element

Maximum bit rate for downlink, octet 3 (see 3GPP TS 23.107 \[81\])

The coding is identical to that of the maximum bit rate for downlink,
octet 9, in the *Quality of service* information element (see subclause
10.5.6.5).

If the sending entity wants to indicate a maximum bit rate for downlink
higher than 8640 kbps, it shall set octet 3 to "11111110", i.e. 8640
kbps, and shall encode the value for the maximum bit rate in octet 4.

Maximum bit rate for downlink (extended), octet 4

The coding is identical to that of the maximum bit rate for downlink
(extended), octet 15, in the *Quality of service* information element
(see subclause 10.5.6.5).

#### 10.5.6.15 MBMS protocol configuration options

The purpose of the *MBMS protocol configuration options* information
element is to:

\- transfer protocol options associated with the bearer level of an MBMS
context activation, and

\- transfer additional MBMS bearer related (protocol) data (e.g.
configuration parameters, error codes or messages/events).

The *MBMS protocol configuration options* is a type 4 information
element with a minimum length of 3 octets and a maximum length of 253
octets.

The *MBMS* *protocol configuration options* information element is coded
as shown in figure 10.5.156/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.170/3GPP TS
24.008.

| NOTE: The reason for defining the information element is to have a    |
| transparent mechanism in the SGSN available from the introduction of  |
| MBMS. This will ensure that MS -- GGSN communication is possible if   |
| new MBMS bearer service related parameters are defined.               |

#### 10.5.6.17 Request type

The purpose of the Request type information element is to indicate
whether the MS requests to establish a new connectivity to a PDN or keep
the connection(s) to which it has connected via non-3GPP access.

The Request type information element is also used to indicate that the
MS is requesting connectivity to a PDN that provides emergency bearer
services.

The Request type information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.158/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.173/3GPP TS 24.008.

The Request type is a type 1 information element.

#### 10.5.6.20 WLAN offload acceptability

The purpose of the *WLAN offload* *acceptability* information element is
to indicate whether traffic can be offloaded using a PDN connection via
a WLAN, or not.

The values \"offloading the traffic of the PDN connection via a WLAN
when in S1 mode is acceptable\" and \"offloading the traffic of the PDN
connection via a WLAN when in Iu mode is acceptable\" map to
\"indication that the PDP context is offloadable\" as defined in
3GPP TS 23.060 \[74\] and 3GPP TS 23.401 \[122\]. The value \"offloading
the traffic of the PDN connection via a WLAN when in S1 mode is not
acceptable\" and \"offloading the traffic of the PDN connection via a
WLAN when in Iu mode is not acceptable\" map to \"indication that the
PDP context is not offloadable\" as defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 \[74\] and
3GPP TS 23.401 \[122\]. The procedures in 3GPP TS 23.060 \[74\] when the
MS receives the UTRAN offload acceptability value in A/Gb mode or Iu
mode apply. The procedures in 3GPP TS 23.401 \[122\] when the MS
receives the E-UTRAN offload acceptability value in S1 mode apply.

The *WLAN offload acceptability* information element is coded as shown
in figure 10.5.6.20-1/3GPP TS 24.008 and
table 10.5.6.20-1/3GPP TS 24.008.

The *WLAN offload acceptability* is a type 1 information element.
